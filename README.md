This is a rudimentary shell implemented using C.

Can run inbuilt commands like cd, pwd, echo and ls. Other commands are run using exec.

A command can be made to run in the background by running the command with an '&' at the end of the command.

Piping and a lot of other specs may not run.

Start the shell by running ./start or if this executable is not present, run ./Makefile first and then ./start to start the shell.

Quit the shell using ctrl+c
